# SnapHireMe
A project inspired by Snapchat. The goal is to create a image blog for users to log in and post pictures. 
The pictures are displayed for a day and deleted automatically. The tools used were React.js in the frontend and 
Django Rest Framework in the backend. The site is also being deployed by Amazon AWS. I was inspired to learn these 
libraries and frameworks through research into what snapchat uses.

Still, waiting for snapchat to hire me, but you can view the project at
